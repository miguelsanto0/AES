# AES
This repository contains a Python script that delves into Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptographic operations. It showcases the encryption and decryption processes, as well as the necessary mathematical operations involved in AES such as byte substitution, shifts, and mix columns functions.

Features
S-Box and Inverse S-Box: Utilizes predefined substitution boxes for byte substitution during the encryption and decryption phases.
Rcon Array: Incorporates an array of round constants used during key expansion.
Finite Field Arithmetic: Implements functions for addition, multiplication, and xtime operation within a finite field, essential for mix columns operation.
Encryption and Decryption Functions: Demonstrates complete AES encryption and decryption cycles using detailed cryptographic transformations.
